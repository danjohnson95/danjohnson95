This week I was lucky enough to not only attend a Laracon (something I've dreamed of since I started my journey with Laravel), but also present a talk at the unconference.

My talk was about adapting your application to work for a global audience.

In my job, I've recently been working on just that. We're signing up new clients all around the globe, and I've been learning a lot about the challenges this comes with. Speaking at the unconference was a great opportunity to share some of the things I've learned.

Here's a brief summary of what I spoke about:

- Why localisation is important
- How to string externalise
- Interpolating strings
- Formatting numbers and dates
- Using tools to help you
- and a live demo of everything pieced together.

Talking about a subject I'm so passionate about was a great experience. Unconference was an excellent introduction to speaking, and I'm looking forward to doing more of it in the future.
